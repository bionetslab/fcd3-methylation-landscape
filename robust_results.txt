Workflow:

	– Download human annotated PPI network from IID (http://iid.ophid.utoronto.ca/).
	– Keep only experimentally confirmed PPIs where both interaction partners are expressed in brain tissue.
	– From lists of differentially methylated genes, discard all genes not contained as nodes in filtered PPI network.
	– Run ROBUST-Web (https://robust-web.net/) with different hyper-parameters to uncover candidate disease mechanisms.
	– Results can be interactively explored online (functional enrichment via g:Profiler, tissue expression, visualization of targeting drugs, etc.).

Hyper-parameters:
	– tau: Explorativeness vs. robustness. The larger tau, the more confidence is required for the algorithm to include a connector node into the results. So results for larger values of tau are much sparser.
	– bias_correction: Correct for study bias in PPI networks. If set to bait_usage, inclusion of proteins used as baits in many AP-MS / Y2H experiments is discouraged.
	– All other hyper-parameters were left at defaults.
